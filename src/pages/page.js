      My snaacckkk!, <strong>Happy Anniversary!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you so much! I can't believe how 2 years just flew by... You've
      been the strongest rock by my side throughout my highs and lows. I still
      remember how in 2021 I had planned a nice little trip to meet my
      bestfriend 🫂. A small hug that you gave me as soon as you arrived to pick
      me up, made so much of a difference, and I couldn't have asked for a
      better turn of events 😍. I have enjoyed each and every moment with you.

      Today, it might feel like, yeah maybe the honeymoon period is over and
      we're more like daal chawal now. But, if this is daal chawal I would love
      this daal chawal for life 💕. You mean far more to me than any exitement
      of regular calls, movie dates, or anything special we can do together.

      You're extremely special, nice, kind, pretty and all the lovely and
      adorable one can be. I can't put it in words, how perfect you are to me.
      Even the days that you're not in the mood or acting rash, it is still good
      to me, I'll never want to lose you no matter what. I'm blessed to have you
      in my life, your love for me shows in every little thing you do 🥰🥰🥰.

      I love how all our fights resolve and we're so loving afterwards. I'm
      sorry for all the times I made you feel not good enough or not pretty.
      You're really a gem to me 💎, and I'm so happy and content with you. The
      best things about you for me is the clear understanding you have towards
      me. I can be my true self with you, make the most of efforts 👉👈, without
      any fear of my effors going waste on unappreciated. In our relationship I
      feel so safe, I don't even fear coming to you with my insecurities, or
      negative thoughts, because you listen so well, are so observant and help
      me out so well 🥺.
